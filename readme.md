Develop with Visual Studio 2022, g++ version 14.2.0.
Please use the corresponding compilation environment.

Everything about A*-plus algorithm and its corresponding experiments are in the 'main.cpp'.
Other ".m" files in the 'graph_drawing' folder are graph drawing script coded by MATLAB. Please run the 'main_draw.m' with MATLAB, version over MATLAB 2019a
Notice that you should run the main.cpp first to generate the map data and the path data files, then move them to the directory of MATLAB files to run graph drawing script in MATLAB.
